This is our paper "River detection in high-resolution SAR data using the Frangi filter and shearlet features."\
published in Remote Sensing Letters (RSL).\

This is Matlab code for river detection. There are some functions to be upload and I will update in the future.\
There maybe also have some problems in the code and I will fix them later.\
